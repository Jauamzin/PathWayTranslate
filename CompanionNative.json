Heber was called as a stake president at age 23 and ordained an Apostle two years later. One of the most dramatic incidents in his apostolic service came in 1893, when he sought divine aid to secure loans to save the Church. Grant's efforts protected the Church from financial collapse during a nationwide economic crisis. The characteristics and life of Heber J. Grant embody principles of self-reliance and persistence that will resonate and be a strength to many BYU-Pathway students around the world."

Wanting to learn to pitch a baseball but not having enough money for a ball, Heber earned the money by shining boots for his mother's boarders. Later he longed to attend the Salt Lake Theatre; instead of feeling sorry that he had no money to buy tickets, he obtained a job as a water carrier for theater patrons and was thus allowed to watch the plays.\n\nAs Heber grew older, his persistence and fortitude were put to good use in business ventures. Offered an appointment to the United States Naval Academy, he opted to stay near his mother and to become a businessman instead. After finishing his schooling at age 16, Heber got a job as a bank clerk and learned bookkeeping. His honesty, ability to work hard, and great desire to learn soon opened up many opportunities. By the time he was 20 years old, he had been made the assistant cashier of Zion's Savings Bank and Trust Company, and he had purchased an insurance agency. The poverty of Heber's youth made him compassionate and prepared him to lead the Church through the aftermath of World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II.",

                "description": "In 1901, Heber J. Grant was called to open and preside over the Japanese Mission. There, Elder Grant dedicated the land for the preaching and reception of the gospel. But the mission did not immediately flourish, partly because of the cultural differences and communication barriers. That did not stop Elder Grant. He worked diligently to learn the new language and to learn of the new culture he was immersed in. Despite the limited missionary success there at the time, Elder Grant oversaw the first translation of the Book of Mormon into Japanese. Of his missionary efforts, President Grant later taught: \"I want you young people to know that in all my labors I got nearer to the Lord, and accomplished more and had more joy while in the mission field than ever before or ever since. Man is that he might have joy, and the joy that I had in the mission field was superior to any I had ever experienced elsewhere.\"\n\nPresident Grant loved to give away books to all those around him; he knew that learning was one of the most important things you could do to further yourself, and he felt a true sense of peace giving away books that had taught him in the past. He gave away thousands of them, most of which he personally inscribed. In giving so many gifts he sometimes lost track of what he had done. \"I once gave a man a book,\" he said, \"and he thanked me very kindly for it, and said, 'Brother Grant, I thoroughly appreciate this book. It is the third copy you have given me of it.'\" After that experience, President Grant kept an index of the books he had given."

                "description": "In 1936, seven years into the Great Depression, the United States had yet to emerge from the huge losses and downward trends that began with the stock market crash in 1929. When President Heber J. Grant spoke of the welfare system in 1936, he envisioned that \"no new Church machinery\" would be required but that \"stake and ward organizations, the priesthood quorums, the Relief Society, and the various auxiliary organizations [would] render the maximum service [they] could furnish in the interest of the general welfare of the Church.\" The Lord had already established the organization needed to bless the poor and needy‚Äîpriesthood quorums were in place, Relief Societies were organized, and the priesthood of God was on the earth.\n\nSince the welfare program was introduced in 1936, members of the Church have labored together to relieve the suffering of those who stand in need. Economic downturns, natural disasters, unemployment, sickness and disability, or times of loss have all required the direction of the priesthood to ensure that needs are met and that individuals and families are blessed. Over the years millions of members have willingly given of their time and talents to bless others.\n\nSince the creation of the Bishop's Storehouse, many United States presidents and other leaders from around the world have come to visit the renowned storehouse and to learn more of how they can implement similar welfare ideologies as did President Heber J. Grant. \"The aim of the Church is to help the people help themselves. Work is to be re-enthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our Church membership\" (Heber J.\nGrant, in Conference Report, Oct. 1936, 3).",

Born in Salt Lake City in 1856, Grant was raised by his mother, Rachel Ridgway Ivins Grant, after his father, Jedediah Grant (a counselor to Brigham Young) died when Heber was only a few days old. Heber was called as a stake president at age 23 and ordained an Apostle two years later. One of the most dramatic incidents in his apostolic service came in 1893, when he sought divine aid to secure loans to save the Church. Grant's efforts protected the Church from financial collapse during a nationwide economic crisis. The characteristics and life of Heber J. Grant embody principles of self-reliance and persistence that will resonate and be a strength to many BYU-Pathway students around the world."

Later he longed to attend the Salt Lake Theatre; instead of feeling sorry that he had no money to buy tickets, he obtained a job as a water carrier for theater patrons and was thus allowed to watch the plays.\n\nAs Heber grew older, his persistence and fortitude were put to good use in business ventures. Offered an appointment to the United States Naval Academy, he opted to stay near his mother and to become a businessman instead. After finishing his schooling at age 16, Heber got a job as a bank clerk and learned bookkeeping. His honesty, ability to work hard, and great desire to learn soon opened up many opportunities. By the time he was 20 years old, he had been made the assistant cashier of Zion's Savings Bank and Trust Company, and he had purchased an insurance agency. The poverty of Heber's youth made him compassionate and prepared him to lead the Church through the aftermath of World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II.",

But the mission did not immediately flourish, partly because of the cultural differences and communication barriers. That did not stop Elder Grant. He worked diligently to learn the new language and to learn of the new culture he was immersed in. Despite the limited missionary success there at the time, Elder Grant oversaw the first translation of the Book of Mormon into Japanese. Of his missionary efforts, President Grant later taught: \"I want you young people to know that in all my labors I got nearer to the Lord, and accomplished more and had more joy while in the mission field than ever before or ever since. Man is that he might have joy, and the joy that I had in the mission field was superior to any I had ever experienced elsewhere.\"\n\nPresident Grant loved to give away books to all those around him; he knew that learning was one of the most important things you could do to further yourself, and he felt a true sense of peace giving away books that had taught him in the past. He gave away thousands of them, most of which he personally inscribed. In giving so many gifts he sometimes lost track of what he had done. \"I once gave a man a book,\" he said, \"and he thanked me very kindly for it, and said, 'Brother Grant, I thoroughly appreciate this book. It is the third copy you have given me of it.'\" After that experience, President Grant kept an index of the books he had given."

When President Heber J. Grant spoke of the welfare system in 1936, he envisioned that \"no new Church machinery\" would be required but that \"stake and ward organizations, the priesthood quorums, the Relief Society, and the various auxiliary organizations [would] render the maximum service [they] could furnish in the interest of the general welfare of the Church.\" The Lord had already established the organization needed to bless the poor and needy‚Äîpriesthood quorums were in place, Relief Societies were organized, and the priesthood of God was on the earth.\n\nSince the welfare program was introduced in 1936, members of the Church have labored together to relieve the suffering of those who stand in need. Economic downturns, natural disasters, unemployment, sickness and disability, or times of loss have all required the direction of the priesthood to ensure that needs are met and that individuals and families are blessed. Over the years millions of members have willingly given of their time and talents to bless others.\n\nSince the creation of the Bishop's Storehouse, many United States presidents and other leaders from around the world have come to visit the renowned storehouse and to learn more of how they can implement similar welfare ideologies as did President Heber J. Grant. \"The aim of the Church is to help the people help themselves. Work is to be re-enthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our Church membership\" (Heber J.\nGrant, in Conference Report, Oct. 1936, 3).",

Born in Salt Lake City in 1856, Grant was raised by his mother, Rachel Ridgway Ivins Grant, after his father, Jedediah Grant (a counselor to Brigham Young) died when Heber was only a few days old. Heber was called as a stake president at age 23 and ordained an Apostle two years later. One of the most dramatic incidents in his apostolic service came in 1893, when he sought divine aid to secure loans to save the Church. Grant's efforts protected the Church from financial collapse during a nationwide economic crisis. The characteristics and life of Heber J. Grant embody principles of self-reliance and persistence that will resonate and be a strength to many BYU-Pathway students around the world."

Later he longed to attend the Salt Lake Theatre; instead of feeling sorry that he had no money to buy tickets, he obtained a job as a water carrier for theater patrons and was thus allowed to watch the plays.\n\nAs Heber grew older, his persistence and fortitude were put to good use in business ventures. Offered an appointment to the United States Naval Academy, he opted to stay near his mother and to become a businessman instead. After finishing his schooling at age 16, Heber got a job as a bank clerk and learned bookkeeping. His honesty, ability to work hard, and great desire to learn soon opened up many opportunities. By the time he was 20 years old, he had been made the assistant cashier of Zion's Savings Bank and Trust Company, and he had purchased an insurance agency. The poverty of Heber's youth made him compassionate and prepared him to lead the Church through the aftermath of World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II.",

But the mission did not immediately flourish, partly because of the cultural differences and communication barriers. That did not stop Elder Grant. He worked diligently to learn the new language and to learn of the new culture he was immersed in. Despite the limited missionary success there at the time, Elder Grant oversaw the first translation of the Book of Mormon into Japanese. Of his missionary efforts, President Grant later taught: \"I want you young people to know that in all my labors I got nearer to the Lord, and accomplished more and had more joy while in the mission field than ever before or ever since. Man is that he might have joy, and the joy that I had in the mission field was superior to any I had ever experienced elsewhere.\"\n\nPresident Grant loved to give away books to all those around him; he knew that learning was one of the most important things you could do to further yourself, and he felt a true sense of peace giving away books that had taught him in the past. He gave away thousands of them, most of which he personally inscribed. In giving so many gifts he sometimes lost track of what he had done. \"I once gave a man a book,\" he said, \"and he thanked me very kindly for it, and said, 'Brother Grant, I thoroughly appreciate this book. It is the third copy you have given me of it.'\" After that experience, President Grant kept an index of the books he had given."

                "description": "In 1936, seven years into the Great Depression, the United States had yet to emerge from the huge losses and downward trends that began with the stock market crash in 1929. When President Heber J. Grant spoke of the welfare system in 1936, he envisioned that \"no new Church machinery\" would be required but that \"stake and ward organizations, the priesthood quorums, the Relief Society, and the various auxiliary organizations [would] render the maximum service [they] could furnish in the interest of the general welfare of the Church.\" The Lord had already established the organization needed to bless the poor and needy‚Äîpriesthood quorums were in place, Relief Societies were organized, and the priesthood of God was on the earth.\n\nSince the welfare program was introduced in 1936, members of the Church have labored together to relieve the suffering of those who stand in need. Economic downturns, natural disasters, unemployment, sickness and disability, or times of loss have all required the direction of the priesthood to ensure that needs are met and that individuals and families are blessed. Over the years millions of members have willingly given of their time and talents to bless others.\n\nSince the creation of the Bishop's Storehouse, many United States presidents and other leaders from around the world have come to visit the renowned storehouse and to learn more of how they can implement similar welfare ideologies as did President Heber J. Grant. \"The aim of the Church is to help the people help themselves. Work is to be re-enthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our Church membership\" (Heber J.\nGrant, in Conference Report, Oct. 1936, 3).",
